# Diabetes-prediction

India has the second highest number of diabetics in the world. This motivated me to work on this project which aims to predict whether a person has diabetes on the basis of various health indicators. The data has been obtained from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in India.

SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Trees, K-nearest neighbours and Logistic Regression using GridSearchCV to find optimal parameters

The final model has an accuracy of 78%
